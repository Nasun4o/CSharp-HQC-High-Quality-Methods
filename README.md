High Quality Code

Problem 1.	Refactor Methods
Use the VS solution "Methods.sln".
•	Refactor its code to follow the guidelines of high-quality methods. 
•	Ensure you handle errors correctly: when the methods cannot do what their name says, throw an exception (do not return wrong result).
•	Ensure good cohesion and coupling, good naming, no side effects, etc.
